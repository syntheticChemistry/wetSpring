# Source: Front. Microbiol. 14:1271836 (10.3389/fmicb.2023.1271836)
# Lab: Sandia National Laboratories
# Organism: Nannochloropsis gaditana CCMP526
# Sequencing: Zymo ZymoBIOMIC 16S service, V3-V4 (CCTACGGGGNGGCWGCAG / GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC)

#
# PURPOSE: Ground truth for validating pipeline results on public Nannochloropsis data.
# Any 16S pipeline run on Nannochloropsis outdoor cultures should detect a SUBSET of
# these genera (not all — different strains/settings will have different communities).
# The pipeline is validated if it can taxonomically resolve to genus level and detect
# organisms in the same phyla/families.
